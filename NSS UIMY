  "description": "Otaka Touya and Kandachi Rei have been figure skating partners since they were kids and their goal is the top. There is only one rule between them: they are forbidden from having a romantic relationship. Many successful pairs have met failure because they let intimate feelings get in the way of their performances. They swear they feel nothing for each other but how they behave on the ice says otherwise.<br/>This is a story of a couple who can only show their feelings for each other on the ice.",
